# SudokuSolver
It solves sudoku's! Well a decent amount anyways... I made this in one night so give me some slack. I might improve in the future as I plan to incorperate it with another one of my big projects.

# About
This was made on windows and has no support for other os's I think. idk and idc so do with it as you please. And I personally ran it on my own lua executer but I dont think I used any special functions.
